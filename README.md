# GridLULCPixelCounter
`GridLULCPixelCounter` is a Python script designed for environmental scientists, geographers, and GIS professionals to analyze land use and land cover (LULC) data. It counts the number of pixels for each LULC class within predefined grid cells and calculates the centroid for each cell. The output is a comprehensive CSV file that includes the centroid coordinates along with the pixel counts for each LULC class within each grid cell. This tool is invaluable for spatial analysis, environmental monitoring, and urban planning.
